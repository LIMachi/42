ok-Compatibility OS X / Linux: Use of preprocessing macros and optimised makefile
ok-FPS/UPS stabilisator (using lib time): Obligatory for the Linux port
 (since linux doesn't cap the number of update per second)
ok-Multi-window: Each window is treated like a volatile object, they can be added
 or removed with ease and safeness
ok-Multi-image: Each window can have multiple images and blend them in a temporary
 image (vbuffer) before showing them
ok-Object oriented: Most windows and images can be linked together, and have
 specific function pointers to fill/update them
ok-Use of color: Colors are assigned in multiple fases - 1 when reading the .fdf
 file: if no hexadecimal color is specified after a height, a palette will be
 used, or if a hexadecimal code is found, it will use the code has color.
 2 - when rendering, checks the distance between the screen and object, and will
 grey/blacken the object (fog)
td-Multithread: For speed purpose, thread are often used (parsing of big files,
 rotation of points, rendering, etc...)
ok-Full 3D: This fdf uses accurate 3D rendering (rotation of objects around the
 camera then projection to the screen)
td-FP (First Person): You can roam in the fdf maps like in a First Person game
 (just bind the keys to walk, jump, fly, hover, etc...)
td-Configuration File: This fdf commes with a default configuration, but you are
 free to change it via the "in game" menu or via the config file
td-Interactive .fdf search: You can load a .fdf file using a built-in tree file
 search (note: might have unexpected result on protected files/folders)
td-Face-filling / Texture-mapping: You can toggle the way the inner faces of the
 poligon of the map you are using renders: no inner, one single color/gradient,
 or a texture (.xpm file)
td-Debug terminal: A secondary window will be opened on startup with a "nice
 looking" and minimalistic terminal, you can use it to send commands to the fdf
 or look at the debug (you can toggle multiple levels of verbose using the
 buttons at the top of the window)
td-Can use .bmp and .xpm files as textures (32,24,16,15 bits .bmp, and XPM3 .xpm)
